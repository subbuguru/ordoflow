Ordoflow is a beautifully simple task management application built with Expo and React-Native. Being a simple app, it uses expo-sqlite and React Context for storage and state management respectively.

## Why I Built This

I developed Ordoflow as a simple one-list task manager for myself to avoid context switching. I also wanted to get my dad to start managing his tasks digitally and I figured making an app myself was the best way to inspire him!
